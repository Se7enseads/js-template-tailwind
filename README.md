# üöÄ Getting started

Welcome to [PNAME]!

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:

- [Node](#install-node)
- [pnpm](#install-pnpm)
- [Git](#git)
- [JSON Server](#json-server-setup)

## Pre-requisites

### Node

Before you can use pnpm, you need to have [Node.js](https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-node-js-on-linux-mint/) installed on your system.

To check if node is installed run the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

This command should output the version number of node, make sure this number is greater than `v20.3.0`

**Download and install Node by following this [tutorial](https://www.linuxcapable.com/how-to-install-node-js-on-linux-mint/#Section-3-Installing-Nodejs-Using-Node-Version-Manager-NVM)**

### pnpm

In the terminal, run the following command to install pnpm globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

The `-g` flag installs pnpm globally, making it accessible from any directory on your system.

After the installation is complete, you can verify that pnpm is installed by checking its version:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

This command should output the version number of pnpm, indicating that the installation was successful this number should be greater than `v8.6.0`.

## GIT

Before proceeding, make sure to [download](https://github.com/Se7enseads/{repo}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or to `clone` the project files onto your machine in order to run the project.

To `clone` this repo ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed onto your local machine.

To check if git is already installed, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

To install Git run this command in the `Terminal`

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

### Clone using https

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Se7enseads/{repo}
```

### Clone using SSH

To use [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) you first need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo onto your github account.

To fork this repo click the drop down button or arrow next to the name `fork` and then click on `create a new fork` or click this [link](https://github.com/Se7enseads/{repo}/fork) to direct you to the forking page.

Click on `Create Fork` to fork.

![Fork page](public/resources/forking_page.png "Fork Page")

After forking the repo, click on the drop down arrow next to the `green code button`, select the `SSH option` and copy the code provided.

```bash
git@github.com:[Your-username]/[repo]
```

For more information about git you can checkout the git [documentation.](https://git-scm.com/docs)

# [PNAME] Usage

To use the web app, the required files are need to have been downloaded or cloned. **(Refer to the GIT section in Getting Started).**

## Setup

To run the app follow these steps:

1. Open your file explorer or press `Ctrl + E`.

2. Navigate to where you cloned the folder in this [step](#using-ssh).

3. Right-click on the folder.

4. Click on `Open with Application` and select `Visual Studio Code`.**(The location of these buttons may vary depending on your Operating System)**

5. Open a new terminal by doing `Ctrl + Shift + backticks` or on the title bar select `Terminal` and the select `New Terminal`.

6. A terminal should pop up from the bottom of the screen.

7. Run the following command to install the dependencies needed to run the app and start the app:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

![install & start](public/resources/pnpm_dev.png "pnpm install & start")

8. While holding `Ctrl` click on the blue link `http://localhost:5173`, this should open the web app on the default browser. **_You can copy the link and paste in your preferred browser._**

<mark>**_Note_ :**</mark> If there is something else running on port 5173 the program will automatically use another port another port e.g port 5174.

## JSON Server Setup

To run this challenge you will need a [Mock API](https://web.archive.org/web/20220712163343/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MockServer) (Application Programming Interface) or Mock server to create an [API](https://web.archive.org/web/20230730192208/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to fetch/get data from.

To start using JSON Server, we need to install it.

Without closing the terminal, on the right side click the `+` icon on the top right of the terminal to create a new terminal.

![Plus icon](public/resources/plus_icon.png "Plus Icon")

To start JSON Server, run the following command in the terminal in VSCode. In our case the [name].json is db.json and make sure the [name].db is in that directory.

```bash
json-server --watch src/data/db.json
```

When run, you'll see some messaging about how to access our JSON data. By default, JSON Server will start up on port 3000. You should see a notice that you can access the server at http://localhost:3000. **_Refer [here](#‚ö†-common-errors) if you encounter any errors._**

![JSON Server](public/resources/json_server.png "JSON Server running")

**For more information about JSON Server checkout their [homepage.](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)**

<mark>**_Note_ :**</mark> **Leave the Terminal open for the server to continue running in the background**

In the browser the page should look like this:

![SNAME App](public/SNAME_app.png "PNAME App")

<mark>**_Note_ :**</mark>

- If you encounter any errors refer [here](#‚ö†-common-errors).
- Pressing the `X` on the terminal does not kill any process it just hides. To show the `terminal` press `Ctrl + backtick`

# ‚ö† Common Errors

![pnpm Error](public/resources/pnpm_error.png "Check your command")

1. This error signals that the npm command you run is not correct for the project it should be:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

2. If the website loads but the styling if off check if you have an ad-blocker (U-Block) or a network monitor that is blocking the styling.

3. If the page loads without any data check the path the json server is watching or check if there is a `db.json` in the current directory.<br> If this happens json server creates automatically default data and a db.json to go with it in that directory
